# steam-wishlist-all-time-lows

basic python script to automate getting a user's wishlist and sorting for which games are on sale for an all-time low price. The second part is impossible to implement unless I start recording my own data, so sadly this will forever go unfinished.

steamdb.info doesn't allow scraping and I don't want to force it. No other alternatives are up to date or as comprehensive as that.
